# 🏀 Linear Regression - Predicting Player Performance

## Overview
Build a linear regression model from scratch to predict a basketball/soccer player's points per game based on stats like minutes played, assists, and rebounds.

## Objective
- Understand the mechanics of linear regression
- Implement closed-form and gradient descent versions manually
- Compare performance with `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`

## Dataset
- [NBA Games Stats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nathanlauga/nba-games)
- [European Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer)

## Features to Use
- Minutes Played
- Assists
- Rebounds
- Field Goal Attempts
- Pass Accuracy (for soccer)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## Results
TBD

## 📚 Math Concepts
- Least Squares Estimation
- Gradient Descent
- Cost Function (MSE)
